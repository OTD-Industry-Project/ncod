## Installing Dependencies
Run `npm install` from within both the `client` and `server` folders:

## Starting the App
You will need two terminals open - One for the Express server, and the other for the React app

### Start the Express Server
In the first terminal, and from within the `server` folder run `npm start`

### Start the React app
In the second terminal, and from within the `client` folder run `npm start`

Any changes made to the client should automatically refresh the react app  
Any changes made to the server should automatically restart the server
